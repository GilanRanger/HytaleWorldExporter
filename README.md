# Hytale World Exporter
A command-line tool for exporting Hytale worlds, blocks, and other models as Wavefront OBJ files.

**Currently focusing on exporting Prefab files, as entire region files are in binary format and lack documentation.**

## Roadmap
### Beginning of February 
The command-line tool available for people to try out and report bugs.

### March
- Chunk tint support
- More export formats
- More accurate materials
- Performance Improvements

### Future
- Top-down map UI for visually selecting the area you want to export and toggling settings.
